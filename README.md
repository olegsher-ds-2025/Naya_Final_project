# Naya_Final_project
classification issue
inputs: 
personal data
sensors data

output:
moving activities, that expexted result error?

is data enough for classification model?

optional - data optimization reduce peple trials

check for best model models for the task

feature management reduce features

create model with no optimization and get results. after this optimize data, reduse peple sensors trials and tryto get the same results
