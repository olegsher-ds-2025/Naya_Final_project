# Naya_Final_project
classification issue
## inputs: 
 - personal data
 - sensors data

## possible model outputs:
 - moving activities
 - gender


## Open questions:
 - that expexted result error?
 - is data enough for classification model?
 - check for best model models for the task

optional - data optimization: reduce people and/or trials

feature management reduce features

create model with no optimization and get results. after this optimize data, reduse peple sensors trials and tryto get the same results
